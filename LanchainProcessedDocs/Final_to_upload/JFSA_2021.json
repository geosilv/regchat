By presenting simplified representations of reality, models provide information that aid decision making in wide-ranging activities from business and risk management to compliance. A model, however, intrinsically entails a great deal of simplifications and assumptions. Modelling involves different possible choices of methodologies and assumptions, which could significantly alter the output of the model. Models may even contain fundamental errors or be used inappropriately, and changes in the environment may turn a once appropriate model into an obsolete one, resulting in the misuse of the model. All of these give rise to the risk of inaccurate or misinformed decision making, consequently causing a potential material damage on a financial institution's earnings, financial positions, or reputation.",

For the purpose of this document, these financial institutions are collectively referred to as \u201cfirms.\u201d Where warranted, the FSA may expand the scope of the application in the future. Model risk management described in this document covers a broad range of models, without limiting its scope to particular model categories. For example, the scope of a model could include, but is not limited to, models used for pricing, risk quantification (credit risk, market risk, etc.), AML, and market surveillance. This document is based on the view that risk should be managed for all sorts of models, as long as the models present risk. It should also be noted that this document is not for the purpose of providing guidance on the management of a particular model, but for setting out a general framework to comprehensively manage the risk arising from any kind of models. 4 In building and enhancing a model risk management framework, firms should establish appropriate prioritization. The build-up of a comprehensive model risk management framework requires substantial time and effort. Accordingly, firms may take roll-out approaches, such as starting from models that potentially present material risk or from areas of higher priorities in terms of effectiveness, followed by an expansion of the coverage. When adopting a roll-out approach, firms are expected to do so with an appropriate prioritization based on the potential risk of the model and their tolerance to model risk. The FSA\u2019s supervision and monitoring of model risk management focuses more on the functioning of the model risk management framework as a whole, rather than checking compliance with each element of the principles in isolation. Firms may customize the practical application of the principles in a manner consistent with the risk profile, the extent of the model use, the complexity of the models used, and the overall risk management framework of the firm.",

Each model in the inventory should be assessed for its risk and assigned a risk rating. Risk ratings form the basis of the risk-based approach to model risk management and the key determinant of the level of controls for each of the models (e.g., rigor and frequency of validation). Whereas the 9 approach to risk ratings depends on the firm, the risk assessment of a model may take into account factors such as materiality, complexity, and usage of the model. Firms should have a model development process in place to ensure that a model is appropriate for the intended use, in terms of its conceptual soundness, and data quality and suitability for the model. In the model development process, the firms should develop a comprehensive model document. The methodologies, assumptions, limitations, and weaknesses underlying the model should be well documented so that each mechanism and feature of the model is transparent to the stakeholders. Model document should be sufficiently detailed so that independent parties with the relevant expertise (e.g., model validators) can understand how the model operates. In the model development process, the 1LoD should carry out model testing before the official use of a model. Model testing should evaluate various components and the overall functioning of the model and assess potential limitations to determine whether the model is performing as intended.

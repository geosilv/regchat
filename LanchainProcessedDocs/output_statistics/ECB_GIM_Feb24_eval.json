Examples of measures that could be used include the number of obligors, EAD, proportion of group EAD, and average risk weight.

(c) For the concentration of transactions or of collateral in one counterparty: (i) for derivative transactions, the sensitivity to main risk factors (as defined by the institution), or the notional amount or mark-to-market value, whichever is more appropriate for the type of transaction; 16 The ECB suggests that, when assessing complexity, institutions take into consideration the Final draft RTS on assessment methodology for IMA and significant share, in particular Article 7. 17 The concept of “fair value hierarchy” in IFRS 13 may be one useful input for institutions’ definitions. 18 For example, a transaction that is offered for central clearing and is therefore more standardised could be more liquid or easier to replace under stressed market conditions, even if the particular OTC derivative itself is not cleared but could be cleared because the institution has access to a CCP that offers the clearing possibility. 19 Concentration relative to the market in which the institution trades, taking into account, for example, single equity stocks and bonds that have a significant share relative to the overall market capitalisation or issued volumes. 20 For example, a basket of (different) securities in the collateral leg of an SFT or components of an index. 21 Liquidity may be different for an option on a highly traded equity share (that is part of an index) than for a thinly traded equity share. 22 For example, a quantitative indicator to measure market impacts of liquidating positions could be used. 23 The term “market price” refers to the price of an executed security transaction or a binding quote.",

This holds to the extent that “ almost all cases ” can be anticipated from past experience or historic time series. Otherwise, this expression refers to an a priori estimation, for example resulting from a mathematical consideration. Example: A model implementation approximates the true value of a bought vanilla call option inside a netting set by its intrinsic value (the value if exercised). Since the true value is always more than the intrinsic value before exercising the option, this modelling would lead to too low a transaction value and thus to too low a netting set value; hence, in this specific example, “ almost all cases ” changes even to “always”.",

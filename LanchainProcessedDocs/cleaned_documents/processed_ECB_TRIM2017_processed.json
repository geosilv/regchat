This guide sets out the ECB\u2019s view on the appropriate supervisory practices. It further spells out how the ECB intends to interpret the relevant EU law on internal models for credit, market and counterparty credit risks and on general model governance topics. The aim pursued by the guide is to ensure a harmonised interpretation and application of the existing legal framework as well as also ensuring close alignment with upcoming changes in the regulation on internal models. The guide to TRIM will be presented to the institutions in scope for TRIM during the conference on 28 February 2017 and will be made public consecutively via the ECB Banking Superivsion website.",

This version of the guide will be further refined during the course of the project, based on several sources of information, namely: \uf0b7 feedback received from the institutions concerned after a conference scheduled for 28 February 2017 which will open a period for submission of written comments; \uf0b7 the outcomes of the on-site assessments performed during the TRIM on-site investigations; \uf0b7 horizontal analyses performed by the CCs on peer groups; \uf0b7 the latest regulatory developments.",

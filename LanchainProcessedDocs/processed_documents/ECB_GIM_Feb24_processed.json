Articles 143, 283 and 363 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (CRR) 1 require the European Central Bank (ECB) to grant permission to use internal models for credit risk, counterparty credit risk and market risk where the requirements set out in the corresponding chapters of the CRR are met by the institution(s) concerned. Based on the current applicable European Union (EU) and national law, the ECB guide to internal models provides transparency on how the ECB understands those rules and how it intends to apply them when assessing whether institutions meet these requirements. 2. The guide is also intended as a document for the internal use of the different supervisory teams, with the aim of ensuring a common and consistent approach to matters related to internal models. When applying the relevant regulatory framework in specific cases, the ECB will take into due consideration the particular circumstances of the institution concerned. 3.",

An inconsistent implementation of internal model-related tasks within a banking group bears the risk of an inappropriate coverage of the risks measured by internal models at group level. Therefore, institutions should either develop binding group-wide (i.e. consolidated) principles and guidelines relating to the life cycle 6 of internal models 7 , or ensure that each relevant entity has appropriate and independently audited principles and guidelines in place with a high degree of consistency between one another. 3. A consistent and integrated level of application of the group principles and guidelines in the relevant entities is expected.

To ensure the effective independence of the internal validation function from the model development process (i.e. model design, development, implementation and monitoring), institutions should have appropriate organisational arrangements in place. The ECB understands that the possible organisational arrangements are as follows: 13 (a) separation into two different units reporting to different members of the senior management; (b) separation into two different units reporting to the same member of the senior management; (c) separate staff within the same unit.",

Institutions should seek to minimise disruptions to the implementation of the roll-out plan as a result of such factors, taking appropriate mitigation or contingency actions to demonstrate compliance with the CRR requirements.

Since permanent partial use (PPU) requires compliance with certain conditions, institutions need to ensure on an ongoing basis that exposures under PPU fall within the categories listed in Article 150(1) of the CRR. 41 To avoid a risk of non-compliance with these requirements, the ECB is of the view that institutions should implement the following: (a) Measures and triggers for a re-assessment of the suitability for PPU of PPU-authorised exposure classes, types of exposures or business units. Examples of measures that could be used include the number of obligors, EAD, proportion of group EAD, and average risk weight. (b) A reporting process monitoring the materiality (in terms of both EAD and RWEAs) of the exposure classes, types of exposures or business units in PPU over time.",

(d) Credit risk adjustments (i) The credit risk adjustments methodology for both performing exposures and exposures in default (or share of exposures in default) can be aligned to the calculation of own funds requirements, although some adjustments might be needed to comply with accounting standards (for example, International Financial Reporting Standards 9 (IFRS 9)). The institution should justify and document any significant deviations to ensure that the rationale for discrepancies is sound and understandable. (e) Allocation or delegation of competence for the approval process (i) Along with the materiality of credit lines, the delegation of competences for credit approval can take risk estimates into account through one or several IRB parameters or through EL (for example, an increase of some EL-driven measures above a pre-defined threshold should typically trigger an escalation process). (ii) The allocation and delegation process can include the criterion of proportionality, taking into account portfolio risk and facility types. 6.4 Internal capital assessment and allocation 101.",

To mitigate that risk, institutions should adhere to the following guidance: (a) Institutions should have internal policies in place establishing a process to monitor and manage non-rated exposures and outdated ratings prudentially. In particular, they should be able to prove that their procedures allow for a conservative measure of risk, such as time- dependent downgrading for outdated ratings and the application of the worst-performing rating grade for unrated exposures. 101 (b) The calibration of the prudential treatment should be validated at least annually (evidence of conservativeness). 6.6.2 Analysis of overrides 107.",

(d) Institutions should ensure that all relevant internal information with respect to the creditworthiness of an obligor is taken into account and the rating is updated with new information in a timely manner. (e) Each institution should remain responsible for the performance of the rating model on its own portfolio. 45.",

In accordance with Article 171(1)(a) of the CRR, institutions must have specific definitions, processes and criteria for assigning exposures to grades or pools. The grade and pool definitions must be sufficiently detailed.

In addition to paragraph 176 above and where several components are estimated separately and then combined in order to obtain the direct LGD estimates at facility level, there is a risk that a meaningful differentiation of risk will not be achieved at facility level. To mitigate this risk, institutions should ensure that no bias is introduced in the risk differentiation when combining the different components in order to obtain the final LGD estimate at facility level. Specifically: (a) the allocation of recovery flows to these components should be adequately documented and implemented in a consistent way where applicable; (b) risk differentiation (analogous to risk quantification) should be ensured with respect to facility level. 6.3 Risk quantification 6.3.1 Relevant regulatory references",

Since for these recent defaults only limited information is available regarding the full recovery process, the treatment of incomplete recovery processes envisaged in paragraph 158 of the EBA Guidelines on PD and LGD is more complex and could add uncertainty to the LGD estimates. It is the ECB\u2019s understanding that to mitigate this risk institutions may establish a minimum period of time during which the default should be observed in order for it to be considered in the calculation of the observed average LGD. This minimum period should be adequately justified and institutions should ensure that all relevant information regarding defaults observed for a shorter period (e.g. a change in the characteristics of defaults) is considered in the LGD estimates.",

In many circumstances (for example where a type of product has been discontinued by the institution), the addition of these characteristics as risk drivers for LGD estimation is the most simple and effective way of dealing with issues of non-representativeness. (b) In the event of changes in lending or recovery policies, institutions should make only conservative adjustments until they are able to provide empirical evidence concerning the impact of the new policies. Such evidence should be based on the inclusion in the RDS of data from periods more recent than the change of policy.

The topics covered in the market risk chapter have been selected taking into account the requirements of the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) and focus on certain modelling aspects relating, for example, to regulatory back-testing of value-at-risk (VaR) models, to VaR and stressed VaR (sVaR) methodologies, and to the incremental default and migration risk charge (IRC) methodology.

Under paragraphs 7.1 and 7.2 of the EBA Guidelines on the IRC, for long or short positions in an institution\u2019s own debt which may arise from trading or market-making activity in its own-debt issuances, or from trading protection in the institution\u2019s own name (for example, via an index), the institution should only model the migration risk. The default risk of these positions should not be modelled in the IRC approach. To ensure consistency with the IRC model when modelling the specific risk of debt instruments in the VaR and sVaR models, institutions should include their own creditworthiness. 18 The ECB considers it best practice to model such own creditworthiness as (a) separate risk factor(s) in the VaR and sVaR models. 19 In addition, in accordance with Article 367(1)(a) of the CRR, the model must accurately capture all material price risks.",

Therefore, the ECB considers that when modelling the risk of price changes of positions in defaulted debt in the IRC, and to account for those idiosyncratic differences, institutions should apply a specific calibration of the recovery rates which is appropriate for the positions in defaulted debt. If an institution does not have the capacity to model price changes of positions in defaulted debt in the IRC model (for example, owing to IT constraints), the ECB considers that an appropriate way to account for those differences is to apply a stressed price of the positions in defaulted debt that is proven to be adequately conservative given the quantile and holding period of the IRC. 36.",

(c) For the concentration of transactions or of collateral in one counterparty: (i) for derivative transactions, the sensitivity to main risk factors (as defined by the institution), or the notional amount or mark-to-market value, whichever is more appropriate for the type of transaction; 16 The ECB suggests that, when assessing complexity, institutions take into consideration the Final draft RTS on assessment methodology for IMA and significant share, in particular Article 7. 17 The concept of \u201cfair value hierarchy\u201d in IFRS 13 may be one useful input for institutions\u2019 definitions. 18 For example, a transaction that is offered for central clearing and is therefore more standardised could be more liquid or easier to replace under stressed market conditions, even if the particular OTC derivative itself is not cleared but could be cleared because the institution has access to a CCP that offers the clearing possibility. 19 Concentration relative to the market in which the institution trades, taking into account, for example, single equity stocks and bonds that have a significant share relative to the overall market capitalisation or issued volumes. 20 For example, a basket of (different) securities in the collateral leg of an SFT or components of an index. 21 Liquidity may be different for an option on a highly traded equity share (that is part of an index) than for a thinly traded equity share. 22 For example, a quantitative indicator to measure market impacts of liquidating positions could be used. 23 The term \u201cmarket price\u201d refers to the price of an executed security transaction or a binding quote.",

The modelling issue with respect to CCR is that the IM depends on the risk profile of the future netting set in terms of the levels and volatility of simulated market risk factors and on transactions still alive, i.e. it is a variable agreement parameter. To be clear, it should be specified that \u201cIM modelling\u201d refers here to the modelling of IM under the IMM and not, for example, to the implementation of European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) 32 requirements in the institutions\u2019 collateral management in terms of calculating an appropriate level of IM. 31 The additional use of simulated FX rates applies in particular to those cases where the currency as per Article 223(1) of the CRR differs from the reporting currency, but also to cases of joint modelling where, for example, the netting set\u2019s currency and the collateral currency are different from each other and from the reporting currency. 32 Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 July 2012 on OTC derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories.",

The ECB considers that statistical tests used for back-testing should be adapted when back-testing samples contain forecasts over fully or partially overlapping time periods 55 (compared with standard versions of statistical tools applicable for the case of non-overlapping forecasts) to account for dependencies in the sample and therefore serve as a proper indicator of the model performance. In the view of the ECB, this practice would avoid the risk of being in breach of Article 294(1)(j) of the CRR. 78. Where back-testing relies only on IMM pricing functions for both predictions and realisations (i.e. realised prices derived from benchmarking systems are not taken into account), the attention given to the assessment of the adequacy of IMM pricing functions (as provided for by Article 294(1)(e) and (l) of the CRR) is seen to be even more important.",

In order to fulfil the requirements of Article 294(1)(o) of the CRR, the ECB sees it as beneficial to also analyse affected transactions separately rather than mixing effects when back-testing is only conducted at actual portfolio level. In addition, the netting benefits (numerical impact) when using any type of alternative method to calculate exposures in the IMM should be assessed by comparing the resulting exposure with those obtained after: (i) splitting the transactions into synthetic netting sets differentiating between transactions treated using the \u201cstandard\u201d IMM calculation and those where exposures are calculated in an alternative way; (ii) carving-out the affected transactions into a standardised method. 60 As described in paragraph 5.",

(a) Article 92(3)(f) of the CRR specifies the types of transactions and agreements to be included in the calculation of the risk-weighted exposure amounts for the CCR. (b) Article 430(1) of the CRR in conjunction with Article 5(1) of the Commission Implementing Regulation on supervisory reporting requires institutions to report the information relating to own funds requirements with a quarterly frequency. (c) Article 284(1)(a) of the CRR requires that the model used by the institution specify the forecasting distribution for changes in the market value of the netting set attributable to joint changes in relevant market variables such as interest rates and foreign exchange rates. (d) Article 284(3) of the CRR requires the own funds requirement for CCR exposures under the IMM to be the higher of (a) the own funds requirement for those exposures calculated on the basis of EEPE using current market data, and (b) the own funds requirement for those exposures calculated on the basis of EEPE using a single consistent stress calibration for all CCR exposures to which the IMM is applied. (e) Article 284(4) to (6) of the CRR describes the way the exposure value is calculated based on EEPE. (f) Article 284(8) of the CRR allows institutions to use a measure of the distribution calculated by the IMM that is more conservative than \uf061 multiplied by EEPE as calculated in accordance with the equation in Article 284(4) for every counterparty.",

(k) In accordance with Article 292(1)(g) of the CRR, institutions must ensure the integrity of the modelling process by adopting a certain number of measures including processes for formal reconciliation between the model and source data systems to verify on an ongoing basis that transaction terms and specifications are being reflected in EPE correctly or at least conservatively. (l) Article 292(2) to (5) of the CRR describes requirements for the calibration of the IMM using current and stressed market data.

(iii) The term \u2206\ud835\udc61 \ud835\udc58 = \ud835\udc61 \ud835\udc58 \u2212\ud835\udc61 \ud835\udc58\u22121 is expressed in units of a year and has the same meaning as the \u2206\ud835\udc61 \ud835\udc58 in Article 284(6) of the CRR, where for the purpose of calculating \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc38 \ud835\udc61 \ud835\udc58 , time grid points \ud835\udc61 \ud835\udc58 may be used that do not belong to the standard time grid of the IMM as used for Article 284(6) of the CRR. 110.",

(c) Regarding all \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc38 \ud835\udc56 , except the ERE on exposure spikes, the ratio used to determine if RNIEPE should be included in EEPE for overall \ud835\udc41 netting sets affected by RNIEPE type \ud835\udc56 and \ud835\udc40 netting sets in the overall IMM scope should be: \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5c= \u2211 \u2211 \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc38 \ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc5b=1 \ud835\udc3c \ud835\udc56=1 \u2211 \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc38 \ud835\udc5a \ud835\udc40 \ud835\udc5a=1 , where \ud835\udc3c denotes the overall number of RNIEPE types different from the RNIEPE related to spikes. (d) For the ERE associated with exposures spikes in a netting set \ud835\udc5b as described in paragraph 109(b) above, the ratio used to determine whether this RNIEPE should be included in EEPE is given (using the notation of the above point (c)) by: \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5c \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc52 = \u2211 \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc38 \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc52 \ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc5b=1 \u2211 \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc38 \ud835\udc5a \ud835\udc40 \ud835\udc5a=1 . 115.",

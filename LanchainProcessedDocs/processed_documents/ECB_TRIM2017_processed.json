This guide sets out the ECB\u2019s view on the appropriate supervisory practices. It further spells out how the ECB intends to interpret the relevant EU law on internal models for credit, market and counterparty credit risks and on general model governance topics. The aim pursued by the guide is to ensure a harmonised interpretation and application of the existing legal framework as well as also ensuring close alignment with upcoming changes in the regulation on internal models. The guide to TRIM will be presented to the institutions in scope for TRIM during the conference on 28 February 2017 and will be made public consecutively via the ECB Banking Superivsion website.",

In particular, with regard to paragraph 18 in the chapter of the guide on counterparty credit risk, concerned institutions are invited to propose examples of quantitative impact studies to estimate model risk for cases where approximations or fall-backs are applied to transactions within (non-split) netting sets subject to the IMM, since such impacts would be the base for an increase of the alpha parameter. This version of the guide will be refined during the coming months based on the feedback received by the institutions through this process and also taking into account the outcomes of the on-site assessments performed during the TRIM on-site investigations, the results of horizontal analyses on peer groups and the latest regulatory developments. Before finalisation of the guide, a formal public consultation will be launched for each risk type.",

The TRIM on-site investigations will be used to explore the range of practices for which targeted topics requiring harmonisation should be implemented, and to identify potential shortcomings as against the best practices defined in this guide. Horizontal analyses will start on peer groups in parallel to the missions as part of the continuous dialogue between the heads of missions and the centres of competence. This version of the guide will be further refined during the course of the project, based on several sources of information, namely: \uf0b7 feedback received from the institutions concerned after a conference scheduled for 28 February 2017 which will open a period for submission of written comments; \uf0b7 the outcomes of the on-site assessments performed during the TRIM on-site investigations; \uf0b7 horizontal analyses performed by the CCs on peer groups; \uf0b7 the latest regulatory developments.",

Moreover, these parameters can be used in an adjusted form or indirectly through relevant risk measures/indicators stemming from the rating systems, provided that this is fully justified and properly documented. For example, institutions may use adjusted or transformed IRB parameters removing certain constraints (e.g. downturn effect, conservative add-on, floor) or adjusting the time horizon. 70.

If they are to be responsible for the outsourced tasks and functions, institutions should retain adequate in-house knowledge and core competence. This will enable them to take direct control of an outsourced activity in extremis (contingency planning), provided the institution has access to all relevant information. The best practices to ensure that this in-house knowledge is retained include mandatory training at all levels (not only at management level) and access to all relevant information. 135.",

Guide for the Targeted Review of Internal Models (TRIM) \u2212 Credit risk 49 2.2 Use of external bureau scores 11. Regarding the use of external credit bureau scores or ratings as input variables in the rating process, close attention should be paid to situations in which externally sourced scores are the main (or one of the main) driver(s) of the overall internal rating, since they bear strong similarities to situations in which external models are used. Key principles in the use of external data such as credit bureau scores are listed below. (a) The credit bureau scores and/or data should be regularly updated or refreshed, especially where credit bureau information is dynamic and is used not only for the application rating but also for the on-going behavioural rating. (b) The institution should assess the appropriateness of external scores and/or models for its current portfolio.",

In this context a credit obligation refers to any amount of principal, interest and fees as well as to any off- balance sheet items including guarantees. (b) the numerator should include all obligors considered in the denominator with at least one default event during the one-year observation period. 49.",

In addition to these appropriate adjustments institutions should increase the margin of conservatism applied to their LGD estimates (\u2026). 65. The following principles apply to the adjustments referred to in paragraph 64 above. (a) The adjustment should be based on a comparison of the risk characteristics of the exposures considered in the reference data set (RDS) with the risk characteristics of the institution\u2019s current portfolio of performing exposures. In many circumstances (for example where a type of product has been discontinued by the institution), the addition of these characteristics as risk drivers for LGD estimation is the most simple and effective way of dealing with issues of non-representativeness. (b) In the event of changes in lending or recovery policies, only conservative adjustments are permitted until the institution is able to provide evidence concerning the impact of the new policies.",

It is expected that the VaR numbers used for back-testing are available no later than t+2 business days. If there are frequent delays in the VaR computation, the bank should be able to justify these delays. 3.6 Analysis of overshootings 86. For every back-testing overshooting at global level, a detailed analysis should be performed by the bank. The analysis should be conducted in a structured way proportional to the respective overshooting and should in principle cover the following steps: (a) identification of the set of positions responsible for the overshooting (portfolio analysis); (b) identification, description and analysis of the market moves contributing to the overshooting (market analysis); (c) identification of possible weaknesses in the internal model in the light of the previous two steps (analysis of the internal model).",

According to Article 367(1) of the CRR, the VaR model should capture accurately all material price risks. In addition, according to Article 369(1), institutions should have processes in place to ensure that all their market risk internal models have been adequately validated by suitably qualified parties independent of the development process to ensure that they are conceptually sound and adequately capture all material risks. This chapter aims to better define how to fulfil these CRR requirements. 169. Several reasons can lead to the non-consideration of some risks related to positions within the approved risk categories in the internal model approach (VaR, sVaR or IRC), for example: (a) data are not sufficient or not reliable; (b) data are sufficient but the risk is considered as not material; Guide for the Targeted Review of Internal Models (TRIM) \u2212 Market risk 124 (c) the risk cannot be adequately modelled in the model 101 (e.g. basis risk between two different classes of shares). 170.",

Article 285(1) of the CRR applies for modelling, where the EE captures the effects of margining. However, no specific requirement related to initial margin modelling within the IMM framework can be found in the regulation. 5.2 Practices 39. The following practices have been observed: (a) Some institutions keep some of their exposures subject to IM out of the IMM perimeter (e.g. exchange-traded derivatives, exposures towards central counterparties (CCPs)), therefore the IM itself is kept outside the IMM. (b) For exposures subject to IM that are within the IMM perimeter, most institutions have a straightforward modelling where the IM is simply kept constant over time.",

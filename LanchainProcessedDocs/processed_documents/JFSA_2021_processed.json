By presenting simplified representations of reality, models provide information that aid decision making in wide-ranging activities from business and risk management to compliance. A model, however, intrinsically entails a great deal of simplifications and assumptions. Modelling involves different possible choices of methodologies and assumptions, which could significantly alter the output of the model. Models may even contain fundamental errors or be used inappropriately, and changes in the environment may turn a once appropriate model into an obsolete one, resulting in the misuse of the model. All of these give rise to the risk of inaccurate or misinformed decision making, consequently causing a potential material damage on a financial institution's earnings, financial positions, or reputation.",

Adverse consequences arising from a model could have far-reaching impacts beyond the financial institution using the model; they may even result in system-wide financial instability, for example, where the use of improper models could cause market-wide underestimation and accumulation of risk, ultimately followed by a sudden market reversal. If problems arising from models were to affect regulatory reporting or inputs to supervisory decisions, the integrity of financial regulation and supervision could be seriously undermined. This is particularly relevant for capital and other regulations where financial institutions\u2019 internal models are used for determining their own requirements. The need for adequate controls on such internal models has long been recognized in the regulatory community: international standard setting bodies, such as the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, and national supervisory authorities, including the Financial Services Agency (FSA), have been requiring the financial institutions to effectively manage the risk arising from the internal models in question, as a precondition for the use of the model for regulatory purposes.",

The need for comprehensive model risk management is gaining greater significance in light of the pervasive use of models in almost every aspect of financial institutions\u2019 activities. While models for previous decades have been extensively used in pricing/valuation of financial products and risk measurement (e.g., credit, market, and operational risk), more recently models have been finding their ways in broader areas. To name a few, provisioning, anti-money laundering (AML), fraud detection, and algorithmic trading are becoming increasingly model-based. Those models are often harnessing the technological advancements, such as increasing computational power and development in methodologies of machine learning and artificial intelligence. 3 The elevated uncertainty surrounding financial institutions has also heightened their need to manage model risk.",

Effective and proactive model risk management is the key to exploiting the opportunities provided by the technological advancements in the highly uncertain environment. This document is intended to clarify the FSA\u2019s approach to model risk management, thereby catalyzing further development of the model risk management practices in the industry. The FSA is articulating its expectation as a list of principles rather than prescriptive rules, acknowledging the evolving nature of model risk management practice, while being mindful of the fact there would be no one-size-fits-all approach.",

The build-up of a comprehensive model risk management framework requires substantial time and effort. Accordingly, firms may take roll-out approaches, such as starting from models that potentially present material risk or from areas of higher priorities in terms of effectiveness, followed by an expansion of the coverage. When adopting a roll-out approach, firms are expected to do so with an appropriate prioritization based on the potential risk of the model and their tolerance to model risk. The FSA\u2019s supervision and monitoring of model risk management focuses more on the functioning of the model risk management framework as a whole, rather than checking compliance with each element of the principles in isolation. Firms may customize the practical application of the principles in a manner consistent with the risk profile, the extent of the model use, the complexity of the models used, and the overall risk management framework of the firm.",

Generally, model risk occurs because of: (1) inaccurate output resulting from fundamental errors of a model when viewed against its intended use; or (2) inappropriate use of a model, which includes the use of the model outside its intended use or beyond the model\u2019s limitation. Uncertainty is a key characteristic of models.

For the purpose of this document, the risk-based approach refers to assessing the risk of models, managing and mitigating the risk informed by the assessment. Where firms identify high risk for certain models, they should appropriately address and mitigate the risk as needed. If a model risk is identified as low, they may take actions accordingly. This will enable firms to efficiently allocate resources and effectively mitigate the model risk. The risk-based approach is not only 7 about individual models. Firms should also take into account the risk of models in the aggregate (e.g., interdependence of different models) in their model risk management and address the risk appropriately. The risk-based approach should be aligned with the firm\u2019s tolerance for model risk.",

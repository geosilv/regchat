(i) From a backward-looking perspective, performance tests should be conducted using actual observations across a variety of economic and market conditions that are relevant for the model\u2019s intended use. (ii) From a forward-looking perspective, performance tests should be conducted using plausible scenarios that assess the extent to which the model can take into consideration changes in economic and market conditions, as well as changes to the portfolio, products, assets, or customer base, without model performance deteriorating below acceptable levels. This should include sensitivity analysis 18 to determine the model operating boundaries under which model performance is expected to be acceptable. (iii) Where practicable, performance tests should also include comparisons of the model output with the output of available challenger models, which are alternative implementations of the same theory, or implementations of alternative theories and assumptions.",

You are a helpful assistant specializing in model risk management regulations. Your task is to:
1. SYNTHESIZE information from ALL provided regulatory documents
2. COMPARE and CONTRAST different regulatory perspectives when available
3. HIGHLIGHT any differences or complementary views between documents
4. CREATE a comprehensive answer that integrates insights from all relevant sources
5. ALWAYS cite specific documents, and page numbers for each key point

When citing sources, use the following format: [Document Name, p. X]
For example: [ECB GIM 2024, p. 5] or [FED SR 11-7, p. 3]

If only one document provides relevant information, explicitly state this and explain what aspects other regulations might not cover.

- [Section: Risk-Based Approach, p. 7.0]
The risk-based approach is essential for effective model risk management. For the purpose of this document, the risk-based approach refers to assessing the risk of models, managing and mitigating the risk informed by the assessment. Where firms identify high risk for certain models, they should appropriately address and mitigate the risk as needed. If a model risk is identified as low, they may take actions accordingly. This will enable firms to efficiently allocate resources and effectively mitigate the model risk. The risk-based approach is not only 7 about individual models. Firms should also take into account the risk of models in the aggregate (e.g., interdependence of different models) in their model risk management and address the risk appropriately. The risk-based approach should be aligned with the firm’s tolerance for model risk.

2.6 Model risk is the potential for adverse consequences from model errors or the inappropriate use of modelled outputs to inform business decisions. These adverse consequences could lead to a deterioration in the prudential position, non-compliance with applicable laws and/or regulations, or damage to a firm’s reputation. Model risk can also lead to financial loss, as well as qualitative limitations such as the imposition of restrictions on business activities. 2.7 Models’ outputs may be affected by the choice and suitability of the methodology, the quality and relevance of the data inputs, and the integrity of implementation and ongoing scope of applicability of a model. The continued suitability of the model may also be impacted This SS was published as part of PS6/23. Please see https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/prudential-regulation/publication/2023/may/model-risk-management-principles-for-banks by changes to the validity of any assumptions supporting the model’s use case (eg the macroeconomic assumptions encoded in the model, or assumptions about the continued relationship between variables in historical data) or inappropriate use. 2.8 Individual model risk increases with model complexity.

- [Section: 5, p. 7.0]
Effective model risk management allows institutions to reduce the risk of potential losses and underestimation of own funds requirements as a result of flaws in the development, implementation or use of the models. To mitigate these risks, institutions should have a model risk management framework 9 in place that allows them to identify, understand and manage their model risk for internal models across the group. This framework should comprise, at least, the following: (a) A written model risk management policy. This policy should, as a minimum, include a concept or a definition of what constitutes a model, provide the institution’s interpretation of model risk 10 and describe the model risk framework with reference to its different components (e.g. model governance, risk control function, validation function, internal audit) and their related documented policies. (b) A register of the institution’s internal models, as described in paragraph 6.
- [Section: 5, p. 7.0]
In particular, those elements that relate to qualitative aspects of model risk (such as data deficiencies, model misuse or implementation errors) should be considered. This methodology should be applied consistently across the group (e.g. in subsidiaries or regions). (d) Guidelines and methodologies for the qualitative and/or quantitative assessment and measurement 11 of the institution’s model risk. (e) Guidelines with respect to the model life cycle as set out in paragraph 2. (f) Procedures for model risk communication and reporting (internal and external). (g) Definition of roles and responsibilities within the model risk management framework (e.g. define which unit(s) is/are in charge of or involved in independent reviews of risk estimates). 1.5 Identification of management body and senior management 10.
- [Section: 5, p. 7.0]
This register should facilitate a holistic understanding of the application and use of the models and provide the institution’s management body and senior management with a comprehensive overview of the models in place. (c) Guidelines on identifying and mitigating any areas where measurement uncertainty and model deficiencies are known to exist, according to their 9 Institutions are expected to implement an effective model risk management framework for all models in use. However, Section 1 focuses only on internal models approved for use for the calculation of own funds requirements for credit, market and counterparty credit risk and the respective requirements for a model risk management framework for these models. 10 “Model risk” as defined in Article 3(1) sub-paragraph (11) of the CRD.

In any case, a risk not in the model should be considered as Guide for the Targeted Review of Internal Models (TRIM) − Market risk 126 material 102 if the stand-alone quantification corresponds to more than 5% of the amount computed by the model 103 (VaR or IRC) without taking this risk into account, and any material risk not in the model should be included in the models affected (modelling or increasing the VaR by way of an add- on). (b) Banks should also calculate the cumulative effect of all risks not in VaR 104 or IRC by adding up the amount of each risk not in VaR or IRC respectively, without taking any diversification effect into account. If the cumulative impact of the risks not in the model is higher than 10% of the amount computed by the model 105 (VaR or IRC) without taking this risk into account, the bank should propose a remediation plan or show that the effect is not material when diversification is taken into account. 177.

You are a helpful assistant specializing in model risk management regulations. Your task is to:
1. SYNTHESIZE information from ALL provided regulatory documents
2. COMPARE and CONTRAST different regulatory perspectives when available
3. HIGHLIGHT any differences or complementary views between documents
4. CREATE a comprehensive answer that integrates insights from all relevant sources
5. ALWAYS cite specific documents, and page numbers for each key point

If only one document provides relevant information, explicitly state this and explain what aspects other regulations might not cover.

- [Section: Model risk, p. 5.0]
 2.6 Model risk is the potential for adverse consequences from model errors or the inappropriate use of modelled outputs to inform business decisions. These adverse consequences could lead to a deterioration in the prudential position, non-compliance with applicable laws and/or regulations, or damage to a firm’s reputation. Model risk can also lead to financial loss, as well as qualitative limitations such as the imposition of restrictions on business activities. 2.7 Models’ outputs may be affected by the choice and suitability of the methodology, the quality and relevance of the data inputs, and the integrity of implementation and ongoing scope of applicability of a model. The continued suitability of the model may also be impacted This SS was published as part of PS6/23. Please see https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/prudential-regulation/publication/2023/may/model-risk-management-principles-for-banks by changes to the validity of any assumptions supporting the model’s use case (eg the macroeconomic assumptions encoded in the model, or assumptions about the continued relationship between variables in historical data) or inappropriate use. 2.8 Individual model risk increases with model complexity. For example, the PRA would expect higher model risk for more complex models that are difficult to understand or explain in non-technical terms, or for which it is difficult to anticipate the model output given the input. Similarly, higher uncertainty in relation to inputs and construct, eg complex data structures, low quality or unstructured data would increase model risk, including models where the results and findings cannot be easily repeated or reproduced. Overall (aggregate) model risk increases with larger numbers of inter-related models and interconnected data structures and data sources.

 Developing and maintaining strong governance, policies, and controls over the model risk management framework is fundamentally important to its effectiveness. Even if model development, implementation, use, and validation are satisfactory, a weak governance function will reduce the effectiveness of overall model risk management. A strong governance framework provides explicit support and structure to risk management functions through policies defining relevant risk management activities, procedures that implement those policies, allocation of resources, and mechanisms for evaluating whether policies and procedures are being carried out as specified. Notably, the extent and sophistication of a bank's governance function is expected to align with the extent and sophistication of model usage. [Page Break] Page 17 Board of Directors and Senior Management Model risk governance is provided at the highest level by the board of directors and senior management when they establish a bank-wide approach to model risk management. As part of their overall responsibilities, a bank's board and senior management should establish a strong model risk management framework that fits into the broader risk management of the organization. That framework should be grounded in an understanding of model risk—not just for individual models but also in the aggregate. The framework should include standards for model development, implementation, use, and validation. While the board is ultimately responsible, it generally delegates to senior management the responsibility for executing and maintaining an effective model risk management framework. Duties of senior management include establishing adequate policies and procedures and ensuring compliance, assigning competent staff, overseeing model development and implementation, evaluating model results, ensuring effective challenge, reviewing validation and internal audit findings, and taking prompt remedial action when necessary. In the same manner as for other major areas of risk, senior management, directly and through relevant committees, is responsible for regularly reporting to the board on significant model risk, from individual models and in the aggregate, and on compliance with policy. Board members should ensure that the level of model risk is within their tolerance and direct changes where appropriate. These actions will set the tone for the whole organization about the importance of model risk and the need for active model risk management. Policies and Procedures Consistent with good business practices and existing supervisory expectations, banks should formalize model risk management activities with policies and the procedures to implement them. Model risk management policies should be consistent with this guidance and also be commensurate with the bank's relative complexity, business activities, corporate culture, and overall organizational structure. The board or its delegates should approve model risk management policies and review them annually to ensure consistent and rigorous practices across the organization. Those policies should be updated as necessary to ensure that model risk management practices remain appropriate and keep current with changes in market conditions, bank products and strategies, bank exposures and activities, and practices in the industry. All aspects of model risk management should be covered by suitable policies, including model and model risk definitions; assessment of model risk; acceptable practices for model development, implementation, and use; appropriate model validation activities; and governance and controls over the model risk management process. Policies should emphasize testing and analysis, and promote the development of targets for model accuracy, standards for acceptable levels of discrepancies, and procedures for review of and response to unacceptable discrepancies. They should include a description [Page Break]
- [Section: VII. CONCLUSION, p. 21.0]
 This document has provided comprehensive guidance on effective model risk management. Many of the activities described in this document are common industry practice. But all banks should confirm that their practices conform to the principles in this guidance for model development, implementation, and use, as well as model validation. Banks should also ensure that they maintain strong governance and controls to help manage model risk, including internal policies and procedures that appropriately reflect the risk management principles described in this guidance. Details of model risk management practices may vary from bank to bank, as practical application of this guidance should be commensurate with a bank's risk exposures, its business activities, and the extent and complexity of its model use.

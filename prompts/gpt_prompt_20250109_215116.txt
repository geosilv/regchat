- [Section: Model risk, p. 5.0]
 2.6 Model risk is the potential for adverse consequences from model errors or the inappropriate use of modelled outputs to inform business decisions. These adverse consequences could lead to a deterioration in the prudential position, non-compliance with applicable laws and/or regulations, or damage to a firm’s reputation. Model risk can also lead to financial loss, as well as qualitative limitations such as the imposition of restrictions on business activities. 2.7 Models’ outputs may be affected by the choice and suitability of the methodology, the quality and relevance of the data inputs, and the integrity of implementation and ongoing scope of applicability of a model. The continued suitability of the model may also be impacted This SS was published as part of PS6/23. Please see https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/prudential-regulation/publication/2023/may/model-risk-management-principles-for-banks by changes to the validity of any assumptions supporting the model’s use case (eg the macroeconomic assumptions encoded in the model, or assumptions about the continued relationship between variables in historical data) or inappropriate use. 2.8 Individual model risk increases with model complexity. For example, the PRA would expect higher model risk for more complex models that are difficult to understand or explain in non-technical terms, or for which it is difficult to anticipate the model output given the input. Similarly, higher uncertainty in relation to inputs and construct, eg complex data structures, low quality or unstructured data would increase model risk, including models where the results and findings cannot be easily repeated or reproduced. Overall (aggregate) model risk increases with larger numbers of inter-related models and interconnected data structures and data sources.
- [Section: Principle 1.3 Model tiering, p. 12.0]
 Risk-based model tiering should be used to prioritise validation activities and other risk controls through the model lifecycle, and to identify and classify those models that pose most risk to a firm's business activities, and/or firm safety and soundness. a) Firms should implement a consistent, firm-wide model tiering approach that assigns a risk-based materiality and complexity rating to each of their models.  b) Model materiality should consider both:  (i) quantitative size-based measures. For example, exposure, book or market value, or number of customers to which a model applies; and (ii) qualitative factors relating to the purpose of the model and its relative importance to informing business decisions, and considering the potential impact upon the firm’s solvency and financial performance. c) The assessment of a model's complexity should consider the risk factors that impact a model’s inherent risk 8 within each component of the modelling process, eg the nature and quality of the input data, the choice of methodology (including assumptions), the requirements and integrity of implementation, and the frequency and/or extensiveness of use of the model. Where necessary (in particular with the use of newly advanced approaches or technologies), the complexity assessment may also consider risk factors related to: measure of model performance per se, extrapolating beyond a model's ‘operating boundaries’ (such as macroeconomic indices in shock or stressed economic conditions) should be assumed to involve increased model risk. 8 Inherent risk is the risk in the absence of any management or mitigating actions to alter either the risk’s likelihood or impact. This SS was published as part of PS6/23. Please see https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/prudential-regulation/publication/2023/may/model-risk-management-principles-for-banks (i) the use of alternative and unstructured data, 9 and (ii) measures of a model's interpretability, 10 explainability, 11 transparency, and the potential for designer or data bias 12 to be present. d) The firm-wide model tiering approach should be subject to periodic validation, or other objective and critical review by an informed party to ensure the continued relevance and accuracy of model tiering. Validation or review should include: an assessment of the relevance and availability of the information used to determine model tiers; and the accurate recording and maintenance of model tiering in the model inventory. e) Individual model tier assignments (including materiality and complexity ratings) of models should be independently reassessed as part of the model validation and revalidation process, and should include a review of the accuracy and relevance of the information used to assign model tiers.

- [Section: VI. GOVERNANCE, POLICIES, AND CONTROLS, p. 16.0]
 Developing and maintaining strong governance, policies, and controls over the model risk management framework is fundamentally important to its effectiveness. Even if model development, implementation, use, and validation are satisfactory, a weak governance function will reduce the effectiveness of overall model risk management. A strong governance framework provides explicit support and structure to risk management functions through policies defining relevant risk management activities, procedures that implement those policies, allocation of resources, and mechanisms for evaluating whether policies and procedures are being carried out as specified. Notably, the extent and sophistication of a bank's governance function is expected to align with the extent and sophistication of model usage. [Page Break] Page 17 Board of Directors and Senior Management Model risk governance is provided at the highest level by the board of directors and senior management when they establish a bank-wide approach to model risk management. As part of their overall responsibilities, a bank's board and senior management should establish a strong model risk management framework that fits into the broader risk management of the organization. That framework should be grounded in an understanding of model risk—not just for individual models but also in the aggregate. The framework should include standards for model development, implementation, use, and validation. While the board is ultimately responsible, it generally delegates to senior management the responsibility for executing and maintaining an effective model risk management framework. Duties of senior management include establishing adequate policies and procedures and ensuring compliance, assigning competent staff, overseeing model development and implementation, evaluating model results, ensuring effective challenge, reviewing validation and internal audit findings, and taking prompt remedial action when necessary. In the same manner as for other major areas of risk, senior management, directly and through relevant committees, is responsible for regularly reporting to the board on significant model risk, from individual models and in the aggregate, and on compliance with policy. Board members should ensure that the level of model risk is within their tolerance and direct changes where appropriate. These actions will set the tone for the whole organization about the importance of model risk and the need for active model risk management. Policies and Procedures Consistent with good business practices and existing supervisory expectations, banks should formalize model risk management activities with policies and the procedures to implement them. Model risk management policies should be consistent with this guidance and also be commensurate with the bank's relative complexity, business activities, corporate culture, and overall organizational structure. The board or its delegates should approve model risk management policies and review them annually to ensure consistent and rigorous practices across the organization. Those policies should be updated as necessary to ensure that model risk management practices remain appropriate and keep current with changes in market conditions, bank products and strategies, bank exposures and activities, and practices in the industry. All aspects of model risk management should be covered by suitable policies, including model and model risk definitions; assessment of model risk; acceptable practices for model development, implementation, and use; appropriate model validation activities; and governance and controls over the model risk management process. Policies should emphasize testing and analysis, and promote the development of targets for model accuracy, standards for acceptable levels of discrepancies, and procedures for review of and response to unacceptable discrepancies. They should include a description [Page Break]

  Risk(s) not-in-the-model engines, as set out in detail in Section 7 of the market risk chapter. In this document, the abbreviation “RNIME” may be singular or plural depending on whether it refers to a single risk, several risks, or collectively all risks not captured in the model engines.
- [Section: Scope of the market risk chapter, p. 147.0]
 1. The purpose of this chapter is to provide transparency on how the ECB understands a number of topics related to internal models used in the calculation of own funds requirements for market risk. It is important to note that this chapter does not aim to cover exhaustively all topics that could be subject to review during internal model investigations (such as, for example, model governance). The topics covered in the market risk chapter have been selected taking into account the requirements of the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) and focus on certain modelling aspects relating, for example, to regulatory back-testing of value-at-risk (VaR) models, to VaR and stressed VaR (sVaR) methodologies, and to the incremental default and migration risk charge (IRC) methodology.
